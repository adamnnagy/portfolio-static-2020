This is the repo for the portfolio site of Adam Nagy. 

I created this project using html, css and js and a little help from bootstrap 4. 
In the future I am considering SEO optimisation and more interactivity.

To Dos: 

[] update projects page
    [] grid for projects
    [] clear irrelevant projects
    [] add new ones
    [] add more info to ones that I'd like to keep
[] merge home and about page
[] add stuff to about page
[] refactor into a framework
