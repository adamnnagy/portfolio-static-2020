						In 2018 Spring I was the Video Desk Editor of The
						Gazelle, a UAE newspaper.
						<br />
						I produced short videos about issues concerning the
						student life of NYUAD. Managed the production team and
						created a shooting schedule. I worked as an all around
						videographer on the productions, shooting and recording
						sound, as well as editing the videos. Recruited
						participants (10+) and conceptualized content that
						reaches the student body of 1200+.
